            Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
        produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.
